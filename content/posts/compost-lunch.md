# Mrs. Muffler's Composting Isn't All Bad

I love to poke fun at Mrs. Muffler, but the truth is we should all be better to the environment.

I'm more of a hippie than I let on. We've both been proud vegetarians for over a decade. I believe the way we treat each other, our planet, and other species matters.

I'll leave the matter there. I create comedy not commentary. Just know that we care. Profoundly.

It's interesting how folks seem to think all vegetarians eat is salad. Mrs. M is an *amazing* cook and can whip up some seriously badass food.

At the risk of looking like a basic "Instagram-Bro"... Here's some pictures of food I recently ate.

This is avocado toast with orzo chickpea salad. Yes, we love avocado toast. Don't judge. That stuff is off the chain. The orzo salad is really good too. I love grabbing it for lunch because it's delish, takes zero prep time, and isn't easily mistaken for compost.

Mrs. Muffler's potato corn chowder soup is like nectar from the gods. She never makes it the same way twice, but it always ends up being delicious anyway. Even my father-in-law and brother-in-law, who are carnivores, love this stuff.

My point is that my life isn't all compost... There's some legitimate culinary amazingness happening... As evidenced by my ever-expanding waste line.

That's it's for now. Until next time...

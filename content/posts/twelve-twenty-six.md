As a kid I never believed in Santa Claus. I grew up super poor. My parents wanted to make for darn sure I knew they bought every gift. I don't blame them. The alternative is believing Santa loves rich kids more.

As an adult I've grown increasingly cynical of Christmas. Not the spirit of it so much. More the execution. I don't understand why showing each other we care has to manifest itself in consumerism.

I'm a grown man. I'll buy my own synthesizer if I want one. Heck, I might just go and build one.

I do like the idea of Santa being real though and being... Perhaps a little different than what we imagine. If Santa were to let loose and be... **gasp** human? What would that look like?

Would he get burned out? Would he spend hours on the phone arguing over Playstation 5 supply issues? Would, maybe, one year the world get to him and he just give up?

I dunno... This is getting way too deep. Go buy some crap for others. Hope others give you the crap you wanted. Merry Christmas.

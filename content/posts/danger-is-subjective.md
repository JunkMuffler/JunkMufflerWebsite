description: Is this song a fart joke or a poop joke? It's a little of both. As a man who's on the wrong side of 35 I've learned to be very, very careful...

Oh fart jokes... You never get old.

One day I fear my inner 11-year-old will die and fart jokes will cease to be funny. Fortunately that has yet to be the case. This is much to the chagrin of Mrs. Muffler. Fart jokes, it seems, are eternal.

Most of my songs are based on real life. I assure you that I did not sh*t my pants in the middle of a Walmart. There's no way I would do something like that. Nope. Nuh-uh. Not me. You won't see me on ["People of Walmart"](https://www.peopleofwalmart.com/) any time soon.

It was Target.

Unfortunately "Target" doesn't rhyme with "Fart". ðŸ¤·

There's a part of me that thinks I should give up comedy. Like honestly? I kind of feel like this video is scraping the bottom of the comedy barrel. Maybe I should try to make real music.

But this? This is me. For better or worse.

Everyone says they don't care what people think of them... It's a lie. Everyone is continually obsessed with what other people think of them. It never ends. It starts in Kindergarten and continues until the day we die.

The closest thing you'll find to someone who is free of this is an artist. It takes absolute guts of steel to put your art out into the world. You have to be prepared for people to criticize you who would never have the courage to be so vulnerable in public.

And yes... I do consider what I do to be art. Perhaps it's not high-brow art. It's never going to be considered on par with Mozart, but it's the art that inside my heart. Cringey? Absolutely... But at the end of the day I just want to make you laugh, man...

Anyway, that's enough introspection. I recognize this video is freaking terrible. Thanks for watching anyway.

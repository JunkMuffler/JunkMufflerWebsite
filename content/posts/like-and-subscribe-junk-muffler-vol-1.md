I'm super-hype to announce the first Junk Muffler album ever! Hopefully it's the first of many more to come. It took me a long time to come up with a collection I was happy with. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

You can find it on all major streaming services. Find yours on the list below and use the link to start blasting this through your headphones!

You can also find the songs on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. I just can't link to them. But if you wanna twerk to a JM Jam? Be my guest.

Thanks so much to all the folks who provided so much encouragement along the way! This album wouldn't have been possible without you!

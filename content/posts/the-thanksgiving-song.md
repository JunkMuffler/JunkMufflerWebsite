Has it seriously been eight months since I released a song? That doesn't seem to be right, but here we are. The YouTube timestamps don't lie.

Wow...

To be fair, a lot of stuff has happened in my life. I'll hopefully share more about it soon. I may make the musical equivelant of candy corn, but I bust my butt on every song. It takes a lot out of me, even though I love it.

And honestly? The past eight months I haven't had a lot to give.

None of that though... Right now? I want to show gratitude. I'm thankful that despite all the stuff I've been through, I've come through relatively intact. In many ways, maybe a bit better.

The holidays matter to me in ways that I can't quite describe. For years I refused to leave the house on Christmas. Thanksgiving and Christmas were the two times a year everyone had to be nice to each other.

As I got older that changed due to circumstance. My low point was spending Thanksgiving at a Denny's.

I almost made that the song, but the memory was a little too depressing.

I've come to realize that the things that are special in this world are the things we take the time to make special. The holidays matter because we choose for them to matter.

Anyway... Happy Thanksgiving y'all. Muffler out. :)

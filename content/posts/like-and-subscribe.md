I feel like subtlety is so undervalued in the music world. Like... What is a song really about? What's the artist's core message? What do they want you to take away from the song?

In case you missed it, the message of this song is to [like and subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6hXeWw6SNTHwWPV6pltgg) y'all... [Like and subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6hXeWw6SNTHwWPV6pltgg).

Fun fact about how I make music... The songs I make are usually driven by [Music Weeklies](https://twitter.com/MusicWeeklies). Each week they post a prompt. You have one week to make a song based off that prompt.

I find this immensely useful. The prompt gets rid of "blank page syndrome." Having a starting point is frequently the hardest part.

The deadline makes sure I actually get something accomplished. Otherwise I'd just sit down in front of my keyboard with a pack of Oreos and doomscroll TikTok's instead of actually making music.

Anyway, the prompt this week was "Broadway Musical". I had NO idea how I was going to pull this off. I've never written anything remotely "Broadway" before. I was stuck until I found a [freaking amazing YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9CwRZfbqLmM).

I'm going to be experimenting with other types of content soon. If you were wondering where the "vlogs" I mentioned in the song are... They're coming. They just... You know... Haven't actually been recorded yet.

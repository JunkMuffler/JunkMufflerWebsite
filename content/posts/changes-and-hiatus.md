Hey Junkyard Dogs! Things are going to be quiet for a bit. This is partially for personal reasons, and partially because I want to take Junk Muffler in a different direction.

This means my posts are going to be even less frequent than normal for a while. I'm not done. I didn't quit. I have a clear vision for the future of JM.

Sigh... Let me just tell you what's going on.

## The (Boring) Personal Stuff

I'm moving across the country to another state. Mrs. Muffler and I have moved around a lot, but this is by far the biggest move we've ever undertaken. It's stressful, there's a lot of uncertainty, and we're both somewhat terrified.

It will be worth it once we're done. This has been a dream of ours forever. I'm excited about it. I'm also completely stressed out.

On top of that, I've really struggled to "feel funny" for quite a while. Even my last few tracks felt "ehhhhh". I kinda regret putting them out.

My headspace has been a problem for as long as I can remember. I finally went and got help for it. It turns out crippling anxiety isn't normal. Who knew?

My only regret was not getting help sooner. We need to normalize talking about mental health.

## The Future of Junk Muffler

This is what I'm super excited about. :)

First, I've realized that trying to force myself to be funny has really crippled my creative output. Instead of being funny, I want to be honest and authentic.

That means some songs may be funny, others might not. It depends on how I feel at the moment. My two favorite songs are [King Neptune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EXIYrVdIs4) and [Grandma's Got a Crush on the Weatherman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWvwh7onk90).

Neither one are necessarily trying to be funny. They're honest though, and they fit my personal aesthetic. I want to make more stuff like that.

I also want to do more than make music. I'm interested in other things like small electronics, 3D printing, improv comedy, and all the typical nerd stuff. I want to bring those aspects of my life into Junk Muffler as well.

For example... I'm really interested in hardware synthesizers. I've thought about buying one, but they're super expensive. There's plenty of resources online for designing and building you're own though. I'd like to try that out and bring you along for the journey.

Junk Muffler will always be about music, but I want to do other stuff too. I'm excited about the projects I have planned and the road ahead. I hope you'll join me for the ride.

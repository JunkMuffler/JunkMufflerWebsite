When I was a strapping young lad during the early days of the internet, there was an incredible flash game called [Don't Sh*t Your Pants](https://princesschoochoo.itch.io/dont-shit-your-pants-pico-8-edition). The significance of this game on my life cannot be overstated. It altered the course of history.

This song is an attempt to take the life lessons learned from this 90's flash game and package it up for you in a festive musical fashion.

I'd love to say my comedic sensibilities of matured since the 90's, but you're here and therefore have likely encountered my music. You know I haven't matured a single bit.

As we roll up on the new year, there's a lot I realize I want to accomplish in 2022. I want Junk Muffler to become a thing... Not neccessarily something that makes money. I don't want my hobby to become a victim of late stage capitalism. Just... A thing that brings joy to the world.

If you're reading this, I hope my music has brought joy to you. Merry Christmas and I'll see you next year. :)

Creating art over the past couple years has been a struggle. I mean, yeah... Life has happened, but I also kinda feel like that's an excuse. The truth is every time I've sat down to make a piece of music? I can't get out of my own head.

I finally decided to make a YouTube video and talk about it.

One thing I didn't mention in the video... At the end of my more recent stuff I play the jingle... "Like like like like like like like subscribe! Lot's of laughs I promise to provide!"

And for a lot of time I just haven't felt like being "funny". It's hard to make good on that promise. So if I can't be funny, is it worth making the video?

Ironically as my mental health has improved, my desire to make comedy has declined. I'm not sure why that is. It's like... There's less darkness in my life so I feel less driven to create light.

But Junk Muffler "is" comedy, so if I want to create something that isn't necessarily funny, what do I do with that? Create another YouTube channel that I ultimately abandon? No. That doesn't seem like the right move either.

Ultimately Junk Muffler is whatever I say it is. If it's comedy? Cool. If it's something else? Cool. The point is I miss making stuff and I'm tired of being so deep in my own head that nothing ever gets created.

I can't promise that there will be a deluge of content after this. What I can promise is that I'm not giving up. I just want to be my own master, not beholden to an almighty algorithm. How you consume my art is not my concern. Once it's out in the world? The author is well and truly dead.

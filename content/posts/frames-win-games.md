I love video games. The problem is I profoundly suck at them. Except for Mario Kart. I'm fairly competent at Mario Kart. :)

I didn't play a lot games as a kid. Every year I'd beg for a Nintendo. Eventually I was given an old school gray and white Game Boy. I loved that thing. I only had a few games for it. One of them was [Tiny Toon Adventures: Bab's Big Break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures:_Babs%27_Big_Break). It wasn't a particularly great game, but 8 year old me was obsessed with it.

When I was a senior in high school I got an original Xbox and played the heck out of Halo. It was amazing until I started playing online. The skill gap between me and even other n00bs was so great that I just died every few seconds. That wasn't fun.

So today I tend to steer away from highly competitive games. Instead I love RPG's, indies, and other artisticly done games.

I also enjoy playing cooperative games with my friends. I've had a blast with Deep Rock Galactic, Phantasy Star Online 2, and other stuff of that nature.

Weirdly there was a time in my life where I thought I wanted to be a game developer. My life took a different turn, but perhaps I'll return to that someday. It's simultaneously easier and harder to get into now.

I have a long history of waiting in line for stuff. I waited in line for 14 hours with my mother for an Xbox 360. I waited 12 hours for an iPhone 3g once. There's a great line from the "Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy" movie with Arthur Dent says "I'm British... I know how to queue!"

I feel like I can relate. Except I'm not British... Though you wouldn't guess it from the amount of tea I drink.

Anyway, thanks as always for listening to my stuff. Until next time, [like and subscribe y'all](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6hXeWw6SNTHwWPV6pltgg)... [Like and subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6hXeWw6SNTHwWPV6pltgg).

# 13 Reasons You Should Like & Subscribe to Me on YouTube (#6 will SHOCK YOU!)

1. Someday I hope to get a recording of one of Mrs. Muffler's legendary house-shaking farts and sample it into a song. 

2. It's proven* that folks who Like & Subscribe to Junk Muffler are on average 37% sexier. 

3. I have some new types of content planned in addition to the songs I put out. Be the first to see what's new in the Mufflerverse!

4. Every time someone Likes and Subscribes I give my dogs another biscuit! Pampered pooch's are relying on your generosity!

5. I dunno if it's true or not, but I heard a rumor the last guy who Liked and Subscribed won $20 on a scratch off. Coincidence? I think not.

6. I actually am planning something AMAZING for when I hit 100 subscribers... It's too early to talk about it, but I've never seen another YouTuber do anything similar... If you're willing to take a chance on me right now? That means a lot to me. 

7. I am an extremely cheap person. All my socks have holes and I'm too cheap to replace them. I've promised Mrs. Muffler that every time someone Likes and Subscribes I'll throw away one holy sock!

8. I'm really, really close to releasing an album. Subscribers will know when it drops first!

9. If you think my socks are bad, my underwear is worse. I've promised Mrs. Muffler that when I hit 100 subscribers I'll throw out all my old underwear and buy new!

10. As an artist it's really hard to tell if you're actually making stuff people like. When you Like & Subscribe it tells me that I'm on the right track.

11. My ego is already the size of Manhatten. Every time someone subscribes it gets a bit bigger. We just don't know how big it can get... So subscribe! For science!

12. I've officially named my subscribers "Junkyard Dogs"... If you ever wanted a profoundly cheesy nickname, here's your chance!

13. You're clearly doomscrolling right now, so I mean... It's not like you have higher priorities at the moment...

*Totally not proven... Yet...

# On Princesses and Potato Chips

Here's a couple of the quizzes mentioned in the song:

[What's your potato chip flavor?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahaspler/what-potato-chip-flavor-matches-your-personality)

I'm kinda curious about your Disney Princess. Tell me what you got in the poll below.

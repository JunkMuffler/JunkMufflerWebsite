The significance of this game on my life cannot be overstated. It altered the course of history.
This song is an attempt to take the life lessons learned from this 90&amp;rsquo;s flash game and package it up for you in a festive musical fashion.</description></item><item><title>Twelve Twenty-Six</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/twelve-twenty-six/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 20:00:17 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/twelve-twenty-six/</guid><description>As a kid I never believed in Santa Claus. I grew up super poor. My parents wanted to make for darn sure I knew they bought every gift. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them. The alternative is believing Santa loves rich kids more.
As an adult I&amp;rsquo;ve grown increasingly cynical of Christmas. Not the spirit of it so much. More the execution. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why showing each other we care has to manifest itself in consumerism.</description></item><item><title>Danger is Subjective</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/danger-is-subjective/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 23:00:17 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/danger-is-subjective/</guid><description>Oh fart jokes&amp;hellip; You never get old.
One day I fear my inner 11-year-old will die and fart jokes will cease to be funny. Fortunately that has yet to be the case. This is much to the chagrin of Mrs. Muffler. Fart jokes, it seems, are eternal.
Most of my songs are based on real life. I assure you that I did not sh*t my pants in the middle of a Walmart.</description></item><item><title>The Thanksgiving Song</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/the-thanksgiving-song/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 22:40:17 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/the-thanksgiving-song/</guid><description><![CDATA[Has it seriously been eight months since I released a song? That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be right, but here we are. The YouTube timestamps don&rsquo;t lie.
Wow&hellip;
To be fair, a lot of stuff has happened in my life. I&rsquo;ll hopefully share more about it soon. I may make the musical equivelant of candy corn, but I bust my butt on every song. It takes a lot out of me, even though I love it.]]></description></item><item><title>Frames Win Games</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/frames-win-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:24:17 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/frames-win-games/</guid><description><![CDATA[I love video games. The problem is I profoundly suck at them. Except for Mario Kart. I&rsquo;m fairly competent at Mario Kart. :)
I didn&rsquo;t play a lot games as a kid. Every year I&rsquo;d beg for a Nintendo. Eventually I was given an old school gray and white Game Boy. I loved that thing. I only had a few games for it. One of them was Tiny Toon Adventures: Bab&rsquo;s Big Break.]]></description></item><item><title>Counting Calories</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/counting-calories-lullaby/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:09:51 -0500</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/counting-calories-lullaby/</guid><description><![CDATA[Here&rsquo;s a lullaby for all my fellow foodies. Also&hellip; For anyone who managed to survive 2020. I feel like since March all anyone I know has done is sit and eat. I know I gained a bunch of pandemic weight that I&rsquo;m working to get off.
I will say that my weakness in breakfast food. In particular, I LOVE pancakes. Before the pandemic hit we did the &ldquo;Tour du Pancakes&rdquo; where I ate at several local restaurants.]]></description></item><item><title>Like and Subscribe: The Musical!</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/like-and-subscribe/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 18:03:19 -0500</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/like-and-subscribe/</guid><description><![CDATA[I feel like subtlety is so undervalued in the music world. Like&hellip; What is a song really about? What&rsquo;s the artist&rsquo;s core message? What do they want you to take away from the song?
In case you missed it, the message of this song is to like and subscribe y&rsquo;all&hellip; Like and subscribe.
Fun fact about how I make music&hellip; The songs I make are usually driven by Music Weeklies.]]></description></item><item><title>Compost Lunch</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/compost-lunch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 20:00:21 -0500</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/compost-lunch/</guid><description><![CDATA[Mrs. Muffler&rsquo;s Composting Isn&rsquo;t All Bad I love to poke fun at Mrs. Muffler, but the truth is we should all be better to the environment.
I&rsquo;m more of a hippie than I let on. We&rsquo;ve both been proud vegetarians for over a decade. I believe the way we treat each other, our planet, and other species matters.
I&rsquo;ll leave the matter there. I create comedy not commentary. Just know that we care.]]></description></item><item><title>Addicted to Doom</title><link>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/addicted-to-doom/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 21:05:56 -0500</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://JunkMuffler.com/posts/addicted-to-doom/</guid><description><![CDATA[13 Reasons You Should Like &amp; Subscribe to Me on YouTube (#6 will SHOCK YOU!)

My initial goal was to write a rip-roaring follow-up to last week&rsquo;s song about a haunted toilet. Instead we got this&hellip; A song that is not without humor but also cut a vein deeper than I planned.
During my formative years (12 - 18) if I wasn&rsquo;t doing school work I was helping to care for my grandparents. My grandfather had an extended illness before passing.]]></description></item></channel></rss>

    <description><![CDATA[Hey Junkyard Dogs! Things are going to be quiet for a bit. This is partially for personal reasons, and partially because I want to take Junk Muffler in a different direction.
This means my posts are going to be even less frequent than normal for a while. I&rsquo;m not done. I didn&rsquo;t quit. I have a clear vision for the future of JM.
Sigh&hellip; Let me just tell you what&rsquo;s going on.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m super-hype to announce the first Junk Muffler album ever! Hopefully it&rsquo;s the first of many more to come. It took me a long time to come up with a collection I was happy with. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
You can find it on all major streaming services. Find yours on the list below and use the link to start blasting this through your headphones!]]></description>

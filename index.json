Instead of being funny, I want to be honest and authentic. That means some songs may be funny, others might not. It depends on how I feel at the moment. My two favorite songs are King Neptune and Grandma‚Äôs Got a Crush on the Weatherman. Neither one are necessarily trying to be funny. They‚Äôre honest though, and they fit my personal aesthetic. I want to make more stuff like that. I also want to do more than make music. I‚Äôm interested in other things like small electronics, 3D printing, improv comedy, and all the typical nerd stuff. I want to bring those aspects of my life into Junk Muffler as well. For example‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really interested in hardware synthesizers. I‚Äôve thought about buying one, but they‚Äôre super expensive. There‚Äôs plenty of resources online for designing and building you‚Äôre own though. I‚Äôd like to try that out and bring you along for the journey. Junk Muffler will always be about music, but I want to do other stuff too. I‚Äôm excited about the projects I have planned and the road ahead. I hope you‚Äôll join me for the ride.

The problem is I profoundly suck at them. Except for Mario Kart. I‚Äôm fairly competent at Mario Kart. :) I didn‚Äôt play a lot games as a kid. Every year I‚Äôd beg for a Nintendo. Eventually I was given an old school gray and white Game Boy. I loved that thing. I only had a few games for it. One of them was Tiny Toon Adventures: Bab‚Äôs Big Break. It wasn‚Äôt a particularly great game, but 8 year old me was obsessed with it. When I was a senior in high school I got an original Xbox and played the heck out of Halo. It was amazing until I started playing online. The skill gap between me and even other n00bs was so great that I just died every few seconds. That wasn‚Äôt fun. So today I tend to steer away from highly competitive games. Instead I love RPG‚Äôs, indies, and other artisticly done games. I also enjoy playing cooperative games with my friends. I‚Äôve had a blast with Deep Rock Galactic, Phantasy Star Online 2, and other stuff of that nature. Weirdly there was a time in my life where I thought I wanted to be a game developer. My life took a different turn, but perhaps I‚Äôll return to that someday. It‚Äôs simultaneously easier and harder to get into now. I have a long history of waiting in line for stuff. I waited in line for 14 hours with my mother for an Xbox 360. I waited 12 hours for an iPhone 3g once.

My initial goal was to write a rip-roaring follow-up to last week‚Äôs song about a haunted toilet. Instead we got this‚Ä¶ A song that is not without humor but also cut a vein deeper than I planned. During my formative years (12 - 18) if I wasn‚Äôt doing school work I was helping to care for my grandparents. My grandfather had an extended illness before passing. Every day we went over to his house so my mother could perform nursing duties (only with none of the training). After my grandpa passed we moved in with my grandmother. The alternative was putting her in a nursing home, a choice my mother was adamantly against. Whether that was the right decision or not is something I‚Äôm still not sure of to this day. What I will say is that elder care is not for the faint of heart. I understand that the conditions in many nursing homes are questionable. There comes a point though when you have to turn it over to professionals. Tending to my grandparents took its toll. The larger issue though is the eccentricities that come with age. Grandma was demanding, entitled, and difficult to live with. She was both an authority figure and someone who I had to care for. That led to many conflicts that didn‚Äôt end well for me. ‚Ä¶And yeah. Part of me resented the fact that I had to help take care of grandma. Especially while other boys were out going to parties, kissing girls, and ‚Äúcoming of age‚Äù. I had a girlfriend but we couldn‚Äôt hang out much. ‚ÄúHey girl, wanna come over and watch the weather with my Grandma?‚Äù That isn‚Äôt exactly the type of thing 16 year old Junk Muffler wanted ask. Of course I couldn‚Äôt go over to my girlfriend‚Äôs house because‚Ä¶ You know‚Ä¶ Grandma. Here‚Äôs the thing though‚Ä¶ I loved her. I still miss her. Inside of me is this duality where I have so many difficult memories of her, yet I still loved her. She cared a lot about me. I know that. I‚Äôll never forget that. This duality in my heart is something that will never go away. The song captures it, even though that wasn‚Äôt my intention. I‚Äôll try to be funny next time. Promise.

What respectable demon couldn‚Äôt torture lost souls with a proper pitchfork? Sadly nobody was able to get through to him. When John hit adolescence he found, somewhere in the depths of Hell, an old Nintendo Entertainment System and a copy of Super Mario Bros. John was immediately entranced. Immediately he knew what he wanted with his life. Forget being an eternal torturer of lost souls. He wanted to be a flipping plumber. ‚Ä¶And so began John‚Äôs education. As he grew older he spent his days halfheartedly working his pain and torment internship. In the evenings he rushed home and watched plumbing videos on YouTube.

How to properly seal joins so water doesn‚Äôt leak and bubble up through the long-suffering homeowner‚Äôs floor.

He wanted to do it himself with some real pipes! So, John snuck out of Hell and ascended to the human world. His eyes burned white hot as he saw what he had longed for all his life.

If you experience an erection for more than four hours after drinking Gamer Ooze please contact your doctor. In some cases Gamer Ooze has proven effective at growing hair in the nose, arm pit, and eyebrow regions of the body. Sadly, no correlation between hair growth on the scalp has been made.

Be assured that the likelihood of such fornication is in fact, quite low. In the event fornication does happen, Gamer Ooze accepts no responsibility. In all likelihood said fornication is the result of the two gallons of Axe Deodorant Body Spray the individual was wearing. Most individuals will experience some degree of light sensitivity after consuming Gamer Ooze. This is not a cause for concern.
